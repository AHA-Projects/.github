## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to broaden participation in computer science and engineering by engaging high school students and teachers—especially from under-resourced communities—in hands-on, community-relevant AI and microelectronics experiences. Funded by the NSF Discovery Research K–12 program, this work combines TinyML, low-cost microcontrollers, and open educational practices to develop engineering identity and 21st-century STEM skills.

**Project Duration:** September 15, 2024 – August 31, 2027  
**Institutions Involved:** University of Florida, University of North Texas, and University of Kansas

**Lead Investigators:** Pasha Antonenko, Swarup Bhunia, Andrea Ramirez-Salgado, Lauren Eustler, Tamzidul Hoque   
**NSF Award Amount:** $1,487,350  
**Program:** Discovery Research K–12 (DRK–12)
