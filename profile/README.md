## ‚ö°Ô∏è Our Edge AI Approach with Edge Impulse

Our curriculum leverages **Edge Impulse** as a core platform to empower high schoolers in developing and deploying AI solutions directly on embedded systems. We've designed the **AHA Board**, a custom electrical circuit board equipped with various sensors (light, heart rate, motion, etc.). This board serves as the primary tool for students to:

1.  **Collect and Engineer Data:** Students gather real-world sensor data from the AHA Board, learning essential data acquisition and pre-processing techniques.
2.  **Train Edge AI Models:** Using Edge Impulse, students train machine learning models based on their collected data.
3.  **Deploy to the Edge:** Trained models are then deployed back onto the AHA Board, enabling real-time, on-device AI inferences.

### Practical AI Use Cases Developed with Edge Impulse:

Our projects demonstrate diverse applications of Edge AI:

* **Motion Detection:** Identifying distinct movements like "Up Down," "Snake," "Idle," and "Wave" using motion sensor data.
* **Proximity Detection:** Utilizing Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors to detect "Object Approaching," "Object Receding," and "Object Stationary" scenarios.
* **Time of Day Classification:** Predicting whether it's "Morning," "Evening," or "Night" based on light and weather sensor data.
* **External Model Integration:** Importing and deploying pre-trained models (e.g., sign language detection trained with Google Teachable Machine) onto the edge via Edge Impulse.
* **Color Detection:** Employing a light sensor to distinguish "Red," "Green," and "Blue" colors, robustly handling fluctuations in ambient light intensity.

### Future Directions: On-Device Large Language Models (LLMs)

We are actively exploring the exciting frontier of bringing **Large Language Models (LLMs) to the edge**. Our future goal is to research and develop techniques for training and compacting LLMs to be efficiently deployable and usable on embedded devices. This advancement holds immense potential for:

* **Reduced Latency:** Real-time processing without relying on cloud connectivity.
* **Bandwidth Conservation:** Minimizing data transfer by processing locally.
* **Enhanced Security & Privacy:** Keeping sensitive data closer to the source.
* **Increased Personalization:** Enabling more tailored and responsive user experiences.
